## Motivation

Our hypothesis is that tightly focused workflows are the best way to align AI capabilities with enterprise customer needs. This pilot with Bridgewater Associates represents our first product engagement to test this hypothesis, focusing on a specific, high-value use case: code optimization.

The pilot targets performance optimization of specific functionality in Bridgewater's codebase where improvements will result in significant cost savings. By maintaining a narrow focus on well-scoped optimization tasks, we can demonstrate clear value while validating our approach to AI-powered developer workflows.

## Pilot Program

We will validate this system through a pilot with Bridgewater Associates, focusing on:

1. **Primary Target**: Dataframe sorting function optimization
2. **Validation Scope**: Two additional code optimization examples
3. **Timeline**: 3 weeks (deadline: April 4th)
4. **Success Criteria**: Significant execution time reduction while maintaining functionality

This pilot serves as a proof-of-concept for our broader optimization system, demonstrating real-world effectiveness on performance-critical code.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation (Week 1)

- [ ] Evaluate existing solutions (Claude Code, Aider, Cursor Composer, Windsurf)
- [ ] Implement sandboxed testing environment
- [ ] Develop and validate performance measurement infrastructure
- [ ] Complete optimization of initial dataframe sorting function

### Phase 2: Iteration & Additional Cases (Weeks 2-3)

- [ ] Receive and implement additional optimization cases from Bridgewater
- [ ] Refine workflow based on learnings from initial case
- [ ] Experiment with alternative code editing approaches if time permits

### Parallel Work Streams

- [ ] Integrate with GitLab workflow
- [ ] Implement Icarus interface components for transparency into agent reasoning

## Resources

- **Timeline**: 3 weeks total
- **Engineering Resources**: [TBD] engineers
- **Compute Requirements**: Bedrock API (may need to request more quota)

## Success Metrics

The primary success metric is execution time reduction while maintaining complete functional correctness. All optimized code must pass the existing test suite. Success will be demonstrated through:

1. Measurable performance improvements in the dataframe sorting function
2. Similar results achieved on subsequent optimization tasks
3. Clear visibility into agent reasoning and optimization strategy through Icarus interface

## Open Questions

1. **Optimization Strategy**:

   - Balance between parallel and sequential optimization attempts
   - Optimal evaluation trigger points
   - Best practices for code editing approach

2. **Infrastructure Concerns**:
   - Security considerations for code execution
   - Performance measurement standardization
   - Version control workflow integration
