# AI Code Optimization Workflow Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design for an AI-powered workflow system that optimizes code in existing codebases. The system aims to improve code performance along multiple dimensions while preserving functionality.

## Pilot Overview

We will validate our code optimization workflow through an initial pilot with Bridgewater Associates. This pilot serves as a proof-of-concept for our broader code optimization system, demonstrating the workflow's effectiveness on real-world optimization challenges.

### Pilot Specifications

- Primary target: Dataframe sorting function optimization
- Validation scope: Two additional code optimization examples from Bridgewater
- Timeline: 3 weeks (deadline: April 4th)
- Success criteria: Significant execution time reduction while maintaining functionality

### Input Requirements

- Target function to be optimized
- Target hardware architecture specifications
- Reference implementation
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Long-term System Goals

- Build a scalable system that uses AI to optimize code performance
- Ensure the AI workflow:
  - Maintains functional correctness of code
  - Delivers measurable performance improvements
  - Integrates with existing development workflows
- Support specific hardware architecture optimization targets
- Provide transparent reasoning and steps taken during optimization

## Success Metrics

1. Performance improvements measured across:
   - Execution time reduction (primary metric for initial pilot)
   - Number of features processed
   - Number of rows processed
2. Preservation of existing functionality (validated through test suite)
3. Successful integration with development workflows

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Research & Evaluation

1. Evaluate existing solutions:

   - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)
   - [Aider](https://aider.chat/)
   - [Cursor Composer](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview)
   - [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)
   - Internal `generate_traces_train` agent

2. Implement sandboxed testing environment:

   - Docker-based isolation for safe code execution
   - Performance measurement infrastructure
   - Unrestricted agent execution capabilities

3. Benchmark solutions:
   - Compare performance metrics
   - Analyze success rates
   - Document failure modes

### Phase 2: Development & Iteration

This phase is intentionally underspecified as our approach will be largely empirical, driven by what we learn from benchmarking existing solutions. We'll iterate based on observed failure modes and performance data.

### Phase 3: Integration

- Build GitLab PR generation pipeline
- Adapt Icarus for customer-facing interface

## Core System Components

While we maintain an open mind about what the data will show us, we have formulated some initial hypotheses about the key abstractions that will likely form the foundation of our solution:

### 1. Localization Engine

**Purpose**: Marshal relevant information from codebase and external resources

**Current Scope**: For this initial implementation, localization is simplified since we're working with single files that can fit entirely within the agent's context. This eliminates the usual complexity of having to carefully select which code to show the agent.

**Future Considerations**:

- Scaling to handle multi-file codebases where context limits prevent showing all code at once
- Developing strategies for large files where only portions are relevant to optimization

### 2. Code Editor

The Code Editor is responsible for making changes to source files. Based on [existing benchmarks](https://aider.chat/docs/benchmarks.html), we're considering three approaches:

#### a) Whole File Editing

In this approach, the agent rewrites the entire file contents when making changes. For example, if optimizing a function, the agent would output the complete file with the optimized function in place.

**Pros**:

- More reliable editing since the agent has full context
- Prevents conflicting changes since each edit is complete
- Since each edit produces a complete file, it's straightforward to detect if multiple edits target the same file, avoiding conflicts

**Cons**:

- Resource intensive, especially for long files, due to large context windows and token generation
- Agents often make unintended changes (e.g., reformatting code or adding type hints) due to their strong priors about "good" code
- Agents sometimes use placeholders like "... existing code ..." which requires additional logic to handle properly

#### b) Diff-Style Editing

This approach involves the agent specifying exact text to replace and what to replace it with. For example:

```python:demo.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
def process_data(items):
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(item * 2)
    return result
=======
def process_data(items):
    return (item * 2 for item in items)
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

### 3. Evaluation System

**Components**:

1. Performance Benchmark

   - Primary focus on execution time improvements
   - Hardware-specific performance metrics
   - Multiple approaches possible for combining metrics:
     - Weighted average of components
     - Area under curve analysis
     - Custom scoring function based on customer priorities

2. Correctness Verification
   - Static test suite: Pre-written tests that verify basic functionality
   - Runtime verification: Dynamic tests that ensure optimized code produces identical outputs to original code
   - Hardware-specific test validation

**Input Requirements**:

- Target function to be optimized
- Target hardware architecture specifications
- Reference implementation
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Performance measurement infrastructure

**Evaluation Triggers**:

- Options:
  1. Agent-initiated testing
  2. Change-triggered evaluation
  3. Fixed-interval testing (every _n_ steps)

### 4. Selection System

**Approach**: Evaluation-driven selection among proposals

**Execution Strategies**:

1. Sequential: Single agent, maximum timesteps

   - Pros: Agent can learn from previous attempts and build on successful changes
   - Cons: Agent can get stuck in a local optimum, repeatedly trying variations of the same suboptimal approach (tunnel vision)

2. Parallel: Multiple agents, fewer timesteps

   - Pros: Explores diverse approaches simultaneously
   - Cons: Each agent has less time to refine its approach

3. Hybrid: Balanced approach
   - Balance between parallel exploration and sequential refinement
   - Optimal ratio will be determined through empirical analysis of agent performance data

## Integration Points

1. GitLab

   - PR generation and review workflow
   - Potential future feature: Agent learns from reviewer comments to improve subsequent optimizations

2. Icarus
   - Serves as the primary customer interface
   - Provides transparency into agent decision-making process
   - Handles configuration management and customer feedback

## Open Questions

- Optimal evaluation trigger mechanism
- Best code editing approach for our use case
- Optimal balance between parallel and sequential execution
