## 1. Introduction

Photosynthesis is the fundamental process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, stored in the form of glucose (a sugar). This process uses carbon dioxide and water as reactants and releases oxygen as a byproduct. The overall chemical equation is:

6CO₂(g) + 6H₂O(l) + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆(aq) + 6O₂(g)

The capture of light energy is facilitated by pigments located within chloroplasts. The primary pigment is chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b), which absorbs red and blue light and reflects green light, giving plants their characteristic color. Accessory pigments, such as carotenoids (carotenes and xanthophylls), absorb light energy at different wavelengths and transfer it to chlorophyll, broadening the spectrum of light usable for photosynthesis.

This lab investigates two aspects of photosynthesis:

1.  **Pigment Separation:** Using paper chromatography to separate and identify the different pigments present in a plant leaf.
2.  **Photosynthesis Product:** Using a leaf filter test (iodine test for starch) to demonstrate that light is necessary for photosynthesis and that starch is a product.

Paper chromatography separates substances based on their differential solubility in a solvent and their affinity for the stationary phase (the paper). More soluble pigments with less affinity for the paper travel further up the paper with the solvent front. The leaf filter test relies on the reaction between iodine and starch, which produces a characteristic blue-black color, indicating the presence of starch produced during photosynthesis.

## 2. Materials

**Paper Chromatography:**

- Fresh green leaves (e.g., spinach)
- Chromatography paper strip
- Chromatography solvent (e.g., petroleum ether and acetone mixture)
- Test tube or beaker with a stopper or cover
- Mortar and pestle
- Small amount of sand
- Acetone
- Capillary tube or toothpick
- Ruler
- Pencil

**Leaf Filter Test (Starch Test):**

- Healthy potted plant (kept in darkness for 24-48 hours prior, then partially exposed to light)
- Beaker (large enough to hold the leaf)
- Test tube
- Ethanol (95%)
- Water bath (hot plate and large beaker with water)
- Forceps
- Petri dish
- Iodine solution (Lugol's solution)
- Water

## 3. Methods

**Paper Chromatography:**

1.  **Pigment Extraction:** Tear a few green leaves into small pieces and place them in a mortar. Add a small amount of sand (to aid grinding) and a few milliliters of acetone. Grind thoroughly with the pestle until a dark green extract is obtained.
2.  **Spotting:** Draw a faint pencil line about 1.5 cm from the bottom edge of the chromatography paper strip. Using a capillary tube or toothpick, carefully apply a small, concentrated spot of the pigment extract onto the center of the pencil line. Allow the spot to dry completely. Reapply the extract to the same spot 10-15 times, allowing it to dry between applications, to create a concentrated spot.
3.  **Developing the Chromatogram:** Pour the chromatography solvent into the test tube or beaker to a depth of about 0.5-1 cm (ensure the solvent level is below the pigment spot on the paper). Carefully lower the chromatography paper strip into the container, ensuring the pigment spot is above the solvent level. The bottom edge of the paper should dip into the solvent. Seal the container with a stopper or cover to create a saturated atmosphere.
4.  **Running the Chromatogram:** Allow the solvent to travel up the paper by capillary action. Do not disturb the container during this time. When the solvent front is about 1-2 cm from the top edge of the paper, remove the strip.
5.  **Analysis:** Immediately mark the position of the solvent front with a pencil before it evaporates. Mark the position of each separated pigment band. Observe and record the colors of the bands. Measure the distance traveled by the solvent front (from the starting pencil line) and the distance traveled by each pigment band (from the starting line to the center of the band). Calculate the Rf (retardation factor) value for each pigment using the formula:
    _Rf = (Distance traveled by pigment) / (Distance traveled by solvent)_

**Leaf Filter Test (Starch Test):**

1.  **Preparation:** Select a healthy plant that has been kept in complete darkness for 24-48 hours to destarch its leaves. Cover a portion of one leaf with opaque material (like black paper or aluminum foil, securing with paperclips) or use a stencil. Expose the plant to bright light for several hours (at least 4-6 hours).
2.  **Killing the Leaf:** Detach the prepared leaf from the plant. Immerse the leaf in a beaker of boiling water for 1-2 minutes using forceps. This kills the cells and makes the cell membranes permeable.
3.  **Removing Chlorophyll:** Turn off the heat source if using an open flame. Place the boiled leaf into a test tube containing ethanol. Place the test tube into a beaker of hot water (water bath) and heat gently. The ethanol will boil and extract the chlorophyll from the leaf. Continue until the leaf becomes pale or whitish. **Caution:** Ethanol is flammable; do not heat it directly over an open flame. Use a hot plate or water bath.
4.  **Softening the Leaf:** Remove the leaf from the ethanol using forceps (it will be brittle) and dip it briefly into the hot water again to soften it.
5.  **Staining for Starch:** Spread the leaf flat in a petri dish and cover it with iodine solution. Leave for a few minutes.
6.  **Observation:** Rinse the leaf gently with water and observe any color changes. Note which parts of the leaf turn blue-black and which parts remain yellowish-brown (the color of the iodine solution).

## 4. Results

**Paper Chromatography:**

- The chromatogram showed distinct bands of color separated along the paper strip.
- Typically, four bands were observed (from top to bottom):
  - Band 1: Orange/Yellow (Carotenes) - Traveled furthest
  - Band 2: Yellow (Xanthophylls)
  - Band 3: Blue-Green (Chlorophyll a)
  - Band 4: Yellow-Green (Chlorophyll b) - Traveled least
- The solvent front traveled [Measure distance, e.g., 8.0 cm].
- Distance traveled by Carotenes: [Measure distance, e.g., 7.6 cm] -> Rf = [Calculate, e.g., 0.95]
- Distance traveled by Xanthophylls: [Measure distance, e.g., 6.0 cm] -> Rf = [Calculate, e.g., 0.75]
- Distance traveled by Chlorophyll a: [Measure distance, e.g., 4.0 cm] -> Rf = [Calculate, e.g., 0.50]
- Distance traveled by Chlorophyll b: [Measure distance, e.g., 3.2 cm] -> Rf = [Calculate, e.g., 0.40]
  _(Note: Actual distances and Rf values will vary based on specific solvent, paper, and conditions.)_

**Leaf Filter Test (Starch Test):**

- The parts of the leaf that were exposed to light during the experiment turned a dark blue-black color when stained with iodine solution.
- The part of the leaf that was covered with the opaque material (and therefore did not receive light) did not change color significantly, remaining a yellowish-brown color (the color of the iodine).

## 5. Discussion

**Paper Chromatography:**
The separation of pigments on the chromatography paper confirms that plant leaves contain multiple pigments involved in photosynthesis. The separation occurs based on the principle of differential solubility and adsorption. Carotenes, being the most soluble in the nonpolar chromatography solvent and having the least affinity for the polar chromatography paper, traveled the furthest up the paper (highest Rf value). Chlorophyll b, being less soluble in the solvent and having a higher affinity for the paper, traveled the shortest distance (lowest Rf value). Xanthophylls and Chlorophyll a showed intermediate solubility and affinity, resulting in intermediate Rf values. The presence of accessory pigments (carotenes and xanthophylls) allows the plant to absorb a wider range of light wavelengths than chlorophyll alone could capture, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis.

**Leaf Filter Test (Starch Test):**
The results of the iodine test clearly demonstrate the requirements for photosynthesis. The blue-black color indicates the presence of starch. This color only appeared in the sections of the leaf that were exposed to light. The covered section, which did not receive light, showed no starch accumulation (no blue-black color). This indicates that light is essential for photosynthesis to occur. Since the plant was initially destarched, any starch detected must have been produced during the period of light exposure. Starch, a complex carbohydrate, is a common storage form of the glucose produced during photosynthesis.

**Sources of Error:**

- **Chromatography:** Inconsistent spotting technique (spot too large or dilute), allowing the solvent front to run off the paper, incomplete saturation of the chromatography chamber, or using old/degraded solvent could affect pigment separation and Rf values.
- **Starch Test:** Incomplete destarching of the plant before the experiment, insufficient light exposure, incomplete removal of chlorophyll (making color change harder to see), or damage to the leaf during handling could lead to ambiguous results.

## 6. Conclusion

This lab successfully demonstrated key aspects of photosynthesis. Paper chromatography revealed the presence of multiple photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenes, xanthophylls) in green leaves, separated based on their physical properties. The leaf filter test confirmed that light is a necessary requirement for photosynthesis and that starch is produced and stored as a result of this process in the light-exposed parts of a leaf. Together, these experiments illustrate the complex interplay of pigments, light, and biochemical processes that constitute photosynthesis.
