# Benchmark Execution Timing

The current implementation does not establish a performance baseline before code modifications begin. The agent starts editing code without first running benchmarks, making it impossible to measure the true performance impact of changes. This means we:

- Cannot verify if changes actually improved performance
- Have no baseline for comparison
- Cannot quantify the magnitude of improvements

# Missing C++ Linting

The absence of C++ linting integration leads to basic errors going undetected until compilation/runtime. Examples include:

1. OpenMP pragma errors with class iteration variables:

```cpp
#pragma omp simd
for (auto it = nan_it; it < sorted_original_ids->end(); ++it) // Error: '#pragma omp simd' used with class iteration variable
```

2. Undefined OpenMP references during linking:

- `GOMP_loop_ull_nonmonotonic_dynamic_start`
- `GOMP_loop_ull_nonmonotonic_dynamic_next`
- `GOMP_loop_end_nowait`
- `GOMP_parallel`

# Model Output Truncation

The agent's attempts to replace entire files sometimes get truncated before the closing code block marker (```). This could be due to:

- Token limit constraints in model responses
- Pipeline processing issues truncating output

# Stateful File Manipulation Issues

The agent uses stateful file replacement commands which are error-prone. For example:

- Accidental content insertion (e.g., Makefile content being inserted into algo.cpp)
- Unintended file modifications
- Lack of atomic operations for file changes

# Critical Function Deletion

The agent has shown a pattern of accidentally removing important functions:

- Deletion of `RunQuickTest` function in multiple PRs
- No validation step to prevent removal of critical code paths
